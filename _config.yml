  With 17+ years experience in the field of Gas Turbine Performance, 10 years working on Defence projects and 7 years working on Civil, I am actively looking for new opportunities within the Gas Turbine Performance field to further my career and broaden my experience.

  I spent 3 years living in Hanoi, Vietnam, during which time I took roles withinin the IT industry, online education and I teaching English as a foreign language.

  I spent 15 months travelling (July 2008 to Oct 2009), primarily overland, from the UK to Bali, via Japan, and beyond to Australia and New Zealand.

  I am married with one child at present.

 # I am most skilled in: <mark>AWS</mark> and <mark>Eating Pizza</mark>

   For this role I am carrying out tasks with the Rolls-Royce Civil Aerospace Performance and Future Projects Departments

   - Trent 7000 Transient Performance Team
     - Using novel modelling methods to determine the potential effects of signal failures on control system client functions and whole engine performance over the whole operating envelope. This required the devlivery of new methods to bulk execute Rolls-Royce in house engine simulation tooling and to analyse the large number results produced in a timely manner to meet cost and timescale requirements.

   - Future Projects
     - Produce a novel interface in Matlab between disparate applications creating a integrated model of a rig being developed to study a new aircraft to engine interface system (subject to NDA)  

   - Trent 1000 Performance Team
     - Analysis of In-service events to support on going monitoring of Rolls-Royce's fleet  Trent 1000 engines.

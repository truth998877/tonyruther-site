Lindsay, former Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford, Keele has always been different from other universities – and, seventy years later, we still are! There was a deliberate aim to break away from the pattern of the specialised honours degree, avoiding as far as possible the divisions between different branches of study. Consequently, most students read four subjects in their degree course, two at honours level and at least two as a subsidiary. At least one of these subjects had to be from the arts or social sciences, and at least one from the natural sciences.
</p><p>I left Keele with a single honours degree in Physics, having completed 2 years of undergraduate Chemistry and subsiduary course in Spanish and Electronics. Students reading two natrual sciences at Keele have the option, in their final year, to specialise in one of their subjects. I choose Physics, leaving me in a unique position for my year group, being the only person who choose this option.</p>

<p>I spent a lot of my free time involved with the University’s Karate club, repesenting the University twice at National level competitions.</p>
